Theme Boost Union is an enhanced child theme of Boost provided by Moodle an Hochschulen e.V.


Work in progress
----------------

This theme is still work in progress and requirements are still discussed.
Please join the discussion on https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/issues.


Requirements
------------

This theme requires Moodle 4.0+


Motivation for this theme
-------------------------

The Boost theme in Moodle core is rather limited in terms of functionality and configurability. We implemented this Boost child theme to accommodate several enhancement needs while keeping the functionality from Boost from Moodle core as much as possible as well.


Installation
------------

Install the theme like any other theme to folder
/theme/boost_union

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins


Usage & Settings

Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes -> Boost Union.

There, you find multiple settings tabs:

### Tab "General settings"

### Tab "Branding"

How this theme works
--------------------

This Boost child theme is implemented with minimal code duplication in mind. It inherits / requires as much code as possible from theme_boost and only implements the extended or modified functionalities.


Plugin repositories
-------------------

This plugin is published and regularly updated in the Moodle plugins repository:
http://moodle.org/plugins/view/theme_boost_union

The latest development version can be found on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union


Bug and problem reports / Support requests
------------------------------------------

This plugin is carefully developed and thoroughly tested, but bugs and problems can always appear.

Please report bugs and problems on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/issues

We will do our best to solve your problems, but please note that due to limited resources we can't always provide per-case support.


Feature proposals
-----------------

Due to limited resources, the functionality of this plugin is primarily implemented for our own local needs and published as-is to the community. We are aware that members of the community will have other needs and would love to see them solved by this plugin.

Please issue feature proposals on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/issues

Please create pull requests on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/pulls

We are always interested to read about your feature proposals or even get a pull request from you, but please accept that we can handle your issues only as feature _proposals_ and not as feature _requests_.


Moodle release support
----------------------

Due to limited resources, this plugin is only maintained for the most recent major release of Moodle as well as the most recent LTS release of Moodle. Bugfixes are backported to the LTS release. However, new features and improvements are not necessarily backported to the LTS release.

Apart from these maintained releases, previous versions of this plugin which work in legacy major releases of Moodle are still available as-is without any further updates in the Moodle Plugins repository.

There may be several weeks after a new major release of Moodle has been published until we can do a compatibility check and fix problems if necessary. If you encounter problems with a new major release of Moodle - or can confirm that this plugin still works with a new major release - please let us know on Github.

If you are running a legacy version of Moodle, but want or need to run the latest version of this plugin, you can get the latest version of the plugin, remove the line starting with $plugin->requires from version.php and use this latest plugin version then on your legacy Moodle. However, please note that you will run this setup completely at your own risk. We can't support this approach in any way and there is an undeniable risk for erratic behavior.


Translating this theme
----------------------

This Moodle plugin is shipped with an english language pack only. All translations into other languages must be managed through AMOS (https://lang.moodle.org) by what they will become part of Moodle's official language pack.

As the plugin creator, we manage the translation into german for our own local needs on AMOS. Please contribute your translation into all other languages in AMOS where they will be reviewed by the official language pack maintainers for Moodle.


Right-to-left support
---------------------

This plugin has not been tested with Moodle's support for right-to-left (RTL) languages.
If you want to use this plugin with a RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, you are free to send us a pull request on Github with modifications.
